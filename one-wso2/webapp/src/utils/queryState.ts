// Putting a screen's view into its query string, and reading it back out.
//
// Finance MIS is the first route in One WSO2 to carry filter state in the URL.
// `features/pinned/pinnableRoute.ts` anticipated it — "No route here carries
// filter state in the URL yet; this is the seam that will already be correct
// for the first one that does" — and this is the other half of that sentence:
// the mechanics live here, shared, rather than inside the first app to need
// them. A screen supplies its own vocabulary; what it should not have to supply
// again is the two rules every such URL owes its reader.
//
// ---- rule 1: a default view serialises to an empty query string -----------
//
// So the address bar stays clean, so a link is short enough to paste into a
// chat, and — the load-bearing one — so "did this link carry a view?" has an
// answer. A serialiser that writes every parameter every time makes that
// question unanswerable, and with it the decision of whether to hydrate a
// screen from the URL or leave it on its own defaults.
//
// ---- rule 2: an unrecognised value is ignored, never thrown on ------------
//
// URLs are typed, truncated by chat clients, hand-edited, kept in bookmarks
// across a deploy that renamed a value, and decorated with tracking parameters
// nobody here has heard of. Every one of those has to land on the default view.
// A parser that throws turns a stale bookmark into an error screen; a parser
// that half-accepts turns it into a view the reader cannot account for. So a
// value is either recognised in full or has no effect at all.
//
// The counterpart is `recognised` on the reader: the count of parameters that
// meant something, which is how a caller decides between hydrating from the URL
// and leaving the screen on its defaults.

/**
 * How one parameter is read out of a URL.
 *
 * `parse` returns `undefined` for anything it does not recognise — that is the
 * whole of rule 2, and it is why every codec here returns rather than throws.
 *
 * Separate from the full codec because not every parameter is read and written
 * the same way round. A parameter with exactly one writable value — `scale=k`,
 * `window=ttm` — has no `format` worth writing: the caller either sets the
 * literal or omits the parameter, and a `format` that ignores its argument and
 * returns the literal anyway would be a lie the type could not catch.

 *
 * A list with nothing left in it is `undefined`, not `[]`. An empty list is not
 * a filter, and returning one would make `?region=` count as an applied filter
 * that happens to match nothing — a view the reader cannot tell from a bug.
 *
 * A comma INSIDE a value is written `%2C`, so "Korea, Republic of" stays one
 * value rather than splitting in two — and a `%` is written `%25`, so a value
 * that already reads `%2C` is not mistaken for one. Only those two: a value
 * without either is written exactly as before, so every link that already
 * works still does. Decoded in one pass, so `%252C` comes back as the `%2C` it
 * was rather than being unescaped twice into a comma. This is the value's own
 * escape, inside the URL's: URLSearchParams encodes it again, so the address
 * bar shows a comma in a value as `%252C`.
