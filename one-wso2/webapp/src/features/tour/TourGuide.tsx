/**
 * The running tour: a card anchored to one control at a time, over a dimmed page.
 *
 * The dim is a single huge spread shadow on the highlight ring rather than four
 * masking panels — one element, no seams, and it follows the target's own box so
 * nothing has to be measured twice.
 *
 * Anchoring is recomputed on scroll and resize because the target is a live
 * element in a live app, not a fixed coordinate. A step whose target vanishes
 * mid-step ends the tour rather than leaving a card pointing at nothing.

        arranged, so a position that is right once is right every time — rather

        the document, so a click on the tour card still reaches it and would
        close the launcher regardless of anything blocking the app tree.
