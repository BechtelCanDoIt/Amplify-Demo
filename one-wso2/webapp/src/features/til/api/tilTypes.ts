// The backend is the only writer of `submittedByEmail` — it reads it from the
// caller's id_token, never from the request body, so a submission can never be
// attributed to someone other than whoever authenticated the call. `who` is a
// separate, human-readable byline (the submitter's own name, e.g. "Jane Doe,
// Customer Success Engineer"), pre-filled by the form from the caller's own
// signed-in identity rather than freely typed; it is NOT the identity check.
// Keeping both means a submission can never be anonymous (submittedByEmail is
// always real) while still letting people describe themselves naturally.
