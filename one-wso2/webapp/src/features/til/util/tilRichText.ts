// back, and the plain-text helpers that let the length limit and the
// "is this actually empty" check reason about content, not markup. Mirrors
// promotion's own promotionRichText.ts (same library, same allowlist); kept
// as its own copy rather than a shared import because PAR's and Promotion's
// equivalents are already separate per-feature copies, not one shared util.

// Sanitized on both write and read: `what` is written by one employee and
// read by every OTHER employee who opens the feed, so the read side never
// trusts that the editor sanitized it either. Text only: no <img>, so a
// pasted or dragged-in picture never reaches storage. The backend sanitizer
// allows the same tags.
