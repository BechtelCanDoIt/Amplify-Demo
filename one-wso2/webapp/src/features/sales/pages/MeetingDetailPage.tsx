/**
 * One meeting: the recording, and the context around it.
 *
 * A ROUTE rather than a dialog, which is the whole point of moving it here. A recording is
 * something people send each other -- "watch the first ten minutes of this" -- and a dialog
 * has no address. This does: /sales/meetings/42 survives a refresh, a bookmark and a
 * paste into Slack, because the page resolves itself from the id rather than from whatever
 * the list happened to be holding.
 *
 * TWO COLUMNS because the left one drives the right: clicking a transcript line seeks the
 * recording. That interaction is the reason the player is a native <video> and not a Drive
 * iframe — an iframe would show the recording but expose no way to set its position.
