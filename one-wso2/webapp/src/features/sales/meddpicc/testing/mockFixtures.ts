// TEST DATA ONLY. Seven made-up Opportunities, each showing one situation the
// screens have to handle:
//
//   Brightwater     Qualify; a Champion Proposal matched to a Contact, and no
//                 Economic Buyer heard yet (so it is an Ask next).
//   Meridian      Technical Proof; a competitor that changed between calls
//                 (Salesforce: Mulesoft -> proposed: Kong), and an Economic
//                 Buyer Proposal with no confident Contact match.
//   Nordlys       Business Proof with its Gate complete: Move stage is offered.
//   Harbourline   Validate, with two earlier Account-only calls to Include.
//   Asterra       Proposal, owned by someone else: read-only.
//   Oakridge      Gate complete, but Salesforce refuses the stage change (422).
//   Kestrel       Closed Won; hidden while "Hide closed" is on.
//
// Every name, company, quote and id here is invented. The store in
// mockStore.ts keeps these as raw Salesforce values and Proposals and derives
// every DealDetail from them, so mutations stay consistent with the circles.
