// Shared page frame for every Marketing Ops screen: an operation eyebrow chip,
// a title + subtitle, and — the reason this exists — ONE place that owns all
// four degraded states, so no screen has to remember to handle them and none
// of them handles them differently:
//
//   1. backend URL not set        → say which config key is missing
//   2. /api/me still in flight    → spinner, never a premature denial
//   3. /api/me failed             → an error with a retry, NOT a denial
//   4. authorized: false          → back to /marketing-ops, which says so once
//
// States 3 and 4 are the pair worth keeping distinct; see the note on
// MarketingOpsGate.isError for why collapsing them misleads the reader. State 4
// used to be a card of its own here (MarketingOpsLocked), naming the Asgardeo
// groups and listing the operations behind them. It said its piece well, but it
// was the second place in the app that answered "you cannot see anything in this
// perspective" — the perspective landing now answers that for all of them, so a
// screen reached by URL hands the question back to it rather than answering it
// again, differently.
//
// Same role as FinanceShell, with the authorization states added. Finance
// doesn't need them because its three backends have no equivalent of Marketing
// Ops' "authenticated but not a member" answer: /api/me deliberately returns
// 200 with `authorized: false` rather than a 403, precisely so the UI can
// explain the situation instead of surfacing a raw failure.
