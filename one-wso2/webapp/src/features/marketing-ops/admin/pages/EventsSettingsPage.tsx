// Marketing Admin → Events member statuses and their columns, as one thing.
//
// They were two sections in Marketing Ops — a list of statuses, and a column editor per
// status — which was wrong. Neither is any use without the other: a status with no
// columns imports every heading on its tab as free text, and a column list belongs to
// exactly one status. So there is one nav of statuses, and selecting one gives you
// everything about it: its name, its score, whether it is live, and its columns.
//
// It sits in Marketing Admin rather than under the Events operation for the same reason
// the Pardot defaults do: these decide what MOP accepts from every regional marketing
// manager, not a preference of whoever happens to be uploading.
//
// What it replaces: two tables of spellings carried in code, each guessing at meaning.
// A tab called "Event attendees" matched nothing and 166 people were dropped in silence.

// A cheap identity for one status' column list, used as part of StatusEditor's key.
// Serializing the definitions is honest about what "the same columns" means — a
// reorder, or a single renamed heading, is a different list, and an editor open on
// the old one should restart rather than keep editing something that moved.
