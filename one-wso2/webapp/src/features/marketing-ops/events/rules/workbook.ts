// Reading the uploaded workbook — in the browser.
//
// Parsing here means the grid appears the moment the file is dropped, with no upload
// round trip, and the attendee data never leaves the machine until the user chooses to
// save. exceljs is loaded on demand so it costs nothing until someone actually uploads.
//
// **Nothing is guessed, and nothing arrives undeclared.** A sheet is imported when its
// tab name IS a member status; a column is imported when its heading IS one an admin
// defined in Settings. Anything else is left in the workbook.
//
// Settings is therefore the contract, not a suggestion. An RMM can keep whatever working
// columns they like in their own sheet — notes to themselves, a column of ticks — and
// none of it reaches MOP, gets validated, or lands in the Pardot CSV unless somebody
// declared it. The alternative, which this replaces, absorbed every stray heading as
// free text: it made the settings page pointless and pushed columns into the CSV under
// raw sheet headings Pardot has no hope of mapping.
//
// The cost of that strictness is that a deviating tab or column imports nothing, so the
// parse reports every sheet it skipped, every heading it passed over, and how many
// values each would have carried. Silence was the bug; refusing quietly would be the
// same bug wearing a different hat.
//
// **The trap this module still exists to avoid.** The template scaffolds 1100 rows per
// tab, every one pre-filled with defaults and formulas. Ask "does this row have any
// non-empty cell?" and a completely blank template answers "1099 rows". A row counts
// only when one of IDENTITY_FIELDS is filled — a name or an email.
