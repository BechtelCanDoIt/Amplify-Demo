// entirely — see the note in marketingOpsApps.ts. This map is the real gate.

// uncomments the item's `path` in the registry.

// for Event Platform, whose one rail entry fronts two sibling capabilities: a
// shop-only user needs the entry to reach the shop, an admin to reach the rest,
// so neither capability on its own is the right gate for it. An empty array
// matches nothing, so a half-edited entry still fails closed.
