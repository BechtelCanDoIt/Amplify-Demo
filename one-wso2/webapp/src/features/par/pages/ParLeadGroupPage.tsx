// The active-cycle tab gate lives HERE rather than in a per-route wrapper
// around each child <Route>, on purpose: this component mounts once per

// resolved once and stays stable. A wrapper re-mounted on every tab click
// would re-run useMeProfile()/useParIsTeamLead() from scratch each time —
// and since useMeProfile's identity resolution (useAsgardeoSub) restarts
// from "loading" on every fresh mount, a disabled-but-not-yet-loading query
// can read isTeamLead as false for one render before identity catches up,
// firing a wrong redirect that then can't correct itself once the guard
// unmounts. Keeping the check on this persistent component sidesteps the
// remount race entirely.
