/**
 * Whether the "PAR" item under Me should be shown at all.
 *
 * Interns do not participate in PAR — confirmed directly, unconditionally:
 * this hides the item for any intern regardless of whether they happen to
 * have a lead or an active cycle in the data. Legacy par-app never hides
 * its own menu entry for anyone (it always shows "Employee Portal"/"PAR
 * History" and falls back to an empty state), so this intentionally
 * diverges from legacy for this one employment type.
 *
 * An earlier version of this hook hid the item ONLY when an intern also had
 * no active cycle and no real/legacy history — on the theory that par-app's
 * own `employeeTypes` config listing INTERNSHIP as cycle-eligible
 * (config.toml) meant an intern could legitimately be mid-cycle. In
 * practice a test intern account with a lead and an active cycle assigned
 * still saw the full tab set, which is wrong: interns don't have PAR, full
 * stop, so eligibility-for-sync is not the same thing as "should see this
 * screen." Simplified to a flat employment-type check — no cycle or
 * history lookups needed here at all anymore.
 *
 * `employmentType` is compared case-insensitively against "internship". The
 * actual wire value is `"INTERNSHIP"` (uppercase): people-app's own
 * `/employees/{id}` and par-app both source this field from the SAME
 * `employment_type` master-data table via digiops-hr's shared `entity`
 * GraphQL service, whose own README documents the field's value set as
 * uppercase strings (`"PERMANENT" | "CONSULTANCY" | "INTERNSHIP" | ...`).
 * Comparing case-insensitively means the exact casing doesn't matter either
 * way.
 *
 * Fails OPEN (visible) once `isPending` clears, same reasoning as
 * useParHasLead: never hide the item just because a fetch hasn't landed —
 * including on a profile fetch error, which each screen enforces access
 * against regardless of what this menu happened to show.
 *
 * Pass a caller's own `isPending`, not `isLoading`: `isLoading` is
 * `isPending && isFetching`, which reads `false` while the profile query is
 * still `enabled: false` awaiting identity resolution — a window where
 * `employmentType` is genuinely unknown but `isLoading` already says "done".
