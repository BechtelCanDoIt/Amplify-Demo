/**
 * Which reader each attachment surface uses.
 *
 * There are two, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 * - `fetchBase64Attachment` decodes base64 TEXT. The cc backend returns
 *   `{body: fileContent.toBase64()}` (service.bal:592) under
 *   `record {| *http:Ok; string body; |}`, so the payload is a base64 string.
 * - `fetchReceiptObjectUrl` reads raw BYTES into a Blob. Expense and OPD
 *   stream the file itself.
 *
 * Cc's details dialog used the blob reader while cc's grid used the base64 one
 * — the same endpoint read two ways. The dialog's preview therefore opened a
 * file whose contents were the literal base64 string. Nothing caught it
 * because the choice is a single import and no test named it.
