// A Finance MIS Build view, as a query string.
//
// The Period lives in the route path (arr-build / qrr-build / mrr-build).
// Everything else that defines a view — Table, Unit, Scale, Window and the
// Applied filters — goes in the query string, so that changing a filter,
// copying the address and sending it to someone else shows them what you saw.
// This module is the only place that knows both the URL vocabulary and the
// internal filter keys.
//
// The mechanics it is built on — omit defaults, ignore anything unrecognised,
// count what was recognised — are shared, in `@utils/queryState`. What is here
// is only MIS's own vocabulary and its conditional rules.
//
// ---- why the rules are copied rather than improved ------------------------
//
// Every rule below comes over verbatim from
// digiops-finance/apps/mis/webapp/src/components/arrDashboard/utils/viewState.js.
// The two apps run side by side through the parallel period (spec §1), and
// people hold links already. Two apps, one URL shape. Where this port does
// depart, the comment says so and names the reason; there are two such places,
// `_applyId` and the summary mirror inside `applyWindow`, both marked below.
