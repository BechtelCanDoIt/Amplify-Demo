// What kind of number a Build row holds, and how each kind is written down.
//
// The two belong together because of one rule, spec §3: **Scale never scales
// counts.** The units/thousands control divides currency rows only; a headcount
// and a retention percentage are the same number either way.
//
// The Build shows all three kinds in the same column — Opening ARR above
// Opening Customers above Net Dollar Retention — so that rule cannot be a
// caller's responsibility. The enforcement is structural rather than
// documentary: `formatMisValue` REQUIRES the kind of number it is being handed,
// and `scale` is read in the currency branch and nowhere else. There is no
// path through this module that divides a count by a thousand, and no default
// that lets a caller reach one by forgetting something.
//
// (The source defaults the kind to currency — `formatArrValue(value)` scales.
// That default is the whole foot-gun, and it is not ported.)
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrDashboard/utils/valueFormat.js` and
// `rowHeaders.js`. Every label is verbatim: they are the row headers the source
// shows, which finance reconciles against during the parallel period (spec §8),
// so they are a transcript rather than this app's own wording.
