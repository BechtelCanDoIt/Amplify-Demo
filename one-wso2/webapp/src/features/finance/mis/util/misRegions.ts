// How a region key off the wire becomes a row, and how it is written.
//
// Both of the Region Summary's views cut their rows by region and both get
// those rows from the RESPONSE rather than from a fixed list, so both have to
// answer the same two questions: is this the same region the last column
// named, and how does finance spell it. The source asks them twice, in two
// copies of `formatRegionLabel` — `useExitArrByRegion.js` and
// `useArrSummaryRegionMetrics.js` — which is one copy too many for a rule
// whose whole job is that two tables agree about what a region is called.

/** The row a region key belongs to: its name, case- and spacing-insensitive. */

 * How finance writes each region, for the keys where the wire and the report

 *
 * The keys BOTH copies of `formatRegionLabel` agree on. They are not the same
 * map: `useExitArrByRegion.js` adds two spellings of its own total row and
 * `useArrSummaryRegionMetrics.js` adds two `wso2 exit` ones. Each table passes
 * its own beside these rather than everyone inheriting everyone's, because a
 * label map is a claim about what a backend sends and neither backend sends the

/**
 * A region key as a row header.
 *
 * ---- one rule of the source's is deliberately narrowed -------------------
 *
 * `formatRegionLabel` uppercases EVERY word of two to four letters, so that
 * unmapped acronyms come out as acronyms. Applied per word it also shouts short
 * ordinary ones: "Middle East" — a region named in that function's own comment
 * — renders "Middle EAST". Here the rule applies only when the whole key IS one
 * short word, which is when it is an acronym; a multi-word key is prose and is
 * title-cased instead.
 *
 * Capitals the wire already sent are kept, so a backend that sends display
 * names gets them back unchanged rather than re-cased on a guess.
 *
 * `labels` is the map to read overrides from, defaulting to the shared one. A
 * table whose backend spells its own total row differently passes that map plus
 * its own aliases; `total` is in the shared map because both tables' backends
 * send that key and both DROP it before labelling, so it is a wire spelling
 * rather than either table's own total row.
