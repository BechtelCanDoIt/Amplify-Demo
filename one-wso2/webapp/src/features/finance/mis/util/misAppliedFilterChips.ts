// The Applied filters, said in words.
//
// The strip under the controls is what makes a shared link legible: it is the
// difference between opening someone's address and seeing a number, and opening
// it and seeing that the number is EMEA, Channel, three years back. The bar's
// menus can say the same thing, but only one at a time and only once opened.
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrDashboard/utils/appliedFilterChips.js`. The
// vocabulary and the order are that file's; what changed is where the rules
// about *which* filters a view has come from — see `describeAppliedFilters`.

 * ---- why this asks the bar which filters exist ----------------------------
 *
 * A chip and a control are two views of one filter, so they have to agree about
 * whether that filter is part of this view at all. The source keeps two
 * separate answers — `usesForecastType`/`usesYearsBack` here, and a different
 * set of conditions inside each of the four Table layouts — and they disagree on
 * a Delayed Build, where the control is shown and the chip is not.
 *
 * So this asks `misFilterBarControls`, the same function the bar lays itself out
 * from. A filter with no control gets no chip, by construction.
