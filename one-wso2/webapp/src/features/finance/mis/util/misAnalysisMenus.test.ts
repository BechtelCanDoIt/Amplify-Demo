// show — where the source has four. That is the deviation this module exists
// for, and it is recorded in spec §7. The source's four:
//
//   Sales Region  a HARD-CODED list of four, or the scrape
//                 (`REGION_OPTIONS_FALLBACK`)
//   Sub Region    `appConfigs.subRegions`, else the scrape — correct
//   Country       `appConfigs.billingcountrys`, else the scrape — and that key
//                 is never on the response, so it is always the scrape
//   Partner Type  `["Channel", "Direct"]` merged with the scrape
