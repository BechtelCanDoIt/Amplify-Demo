// What each of ARR Analysis's four list controls offers.
//
// ---- one rule, where the source has four ------------------------------------
//
// A DEVIATION, recorded in spec §7. The source's four sibling menus are built
// four different ways, and two of them are wrong:
//
//   Sales Region  a hard-coded `["APAC", "EMEA", "Americas", "North America"]`
//                 or the scrape (`REGION_OPTIONS_FALLBACK`) — although
//                 `GET /app-configs` answers with `salesRegions` and the Build's
//                 own bar uses it. The list even carries both "Americas" and
//                 "North America", which is what a stopgap looks like.
//   Sub Region    `appConfigs.subRegions`, else the scrape. Correct.
//   Country       `appConfigs.billingcountrys`, else the scrape — and that key
//                 is NEVER on the response, which declares `billingCountries`
//                 (`arr-backend/.../types.bal`, `MetaData`). So the branch is
//                 dead and the menu is always the scrape, offering only the
//                 countries that survived the current filter.
//   Partner Type  `["Channel", "Direct"]` merged with the scrape.
//
// Here all four read: the backend's list, else what the loaded accounts show.
// That drops the hard-coded regions, fixes the misspelled key, and keeps the
// scrape as the fallback it was always meant to be — which is load-bearing
// rather than decorative, because `GET /app-configs` failing must not leave
// every control on a screenful of data unable to narrow it.
//
// Partner Type keeps its floor of two, because Channel and Direct are the model
// rather than data — the port's own terms for it — so the control can offer them
// before an account has loaded. They are a floor and not a ceiling: an account
// reporting something else is a fact about the book, and a menu that hid it
// would leave rows nothing on the screen can select.
//
// Fixing the country key is not a parity breach (spec §1). Parity protects
// behaviour someone chose and Finance reconciles against; a menu built from a
// key the response has never carried is a typo, its effect is a menu missing
// options rather than a figure reading differently, and no figure moves either
// way.
