// The clock every MIS Period is measured on, and the calendar arithmetic that
// goes with it.
//
// Pacific Time is canonical for Finance MIS — not the viewer's zone and not UTC
// (spec §3). A Period boundary is a business fact: the year a figure
// lands in is decided in California, and a reader in Colombo has to be shown the
// same one.
//
// Two rules hold this file together, and both exist because breaking either is
// silent:
//
// 1. **The zone is named, never offset.** Pacific observes DST, so the
//    fixed-offset trick in `features/menu/util/menuTime.ts` is not reusable
//    here: it is right for IST, which has no transitions, and wrong for this by
//    an hour for eight months of the year. `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with
//    `timeZone: "America/Los_Angeles"` and `formatToParts` is the only thing
//    that knows when the transitions are.
//
// 2. **Nothing round-trips through a local `Date`.** Once an instant has been
//    reduced to a Pacific calendar date, every subsequent step — a year back, a
//    last-of-month, the day after — is arithmetic on those three numbers.
//    `new Date(2026, 0, 1)` is midnight in the HOST's zone, so reading Pacific
//    parts back out of it yields 31 December 2025 for anyone east of California.
//    That is spec §10.8's test, and it is the reason these helpers are plain
//    integer arithmetic rather than `Date` maths.
//
// `instant` is always a parameter. It defaults to now for callers that genuinely
// mean now, but every rule here can be pinned to a moment by a test.
