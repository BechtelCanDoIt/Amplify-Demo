// The filter bar, as rules rather than as a component.
//
// A MIS filter bar is two sets of the same filters: the **Applied** set, which
// the grid reflects and the URL carries, and the **Pending** set, which is what
// the controls are showing while the reader makes up their mind. APPLY is the
// step between them. That distinction is the whole
// reason this module exists — everything here is a question about one of the
// two sets or about the distance between them.
//
// Ported from the state, effects and handlers of the 1,823-line
// digiops-finance `arrDashboard/components/FilterBar.js`. What changed is the
// shape, not the rules:
//
//   - Pending is ONE object, not twenty `useState`s. The source declares a
//     setter per control and a `setPending` that calls all twenty in order.
//   - Pending holds ONE type value and ONE cumulative flag, not three and two.
//     The source carries `arrType`, `qrrType` and `mrrType` simultaneously on
//     every Period and needs a coercion effect per Table to stop a Quarterly
//     choice reaching an Annually grid. `TYPE_KEY_BY_PERIOD` already answers
//     which key a Period uses, so there is nothing to cross-contaminate.
//   - The coercions are a FUNCTION, not four `useEffect`s that fire after a
//     render and set state again. The source needs `normalisePending` anyway —
//     for chip dismissal, which has to apply what the panel is about to show —
//     so it already has both, and they have to agree. Here there is one.
//   - There is no `lastAppliedPending` snapshot. The Applied set lives in the
//     URL (ticket 02), so "are there Pending changes" is a comparison against
//     the address bar rather than against a second copy held in state that has
//     to be kept in step with it.
//
// The unit selection is deliberately absent: it is not a bar control in the
// source either (`FilterBar.js:438` — "BU/Software/Cloud selection is now
// controlled in TableNavigation; no UI here"), and it commits on click rather
// than waiting for APPLY.
