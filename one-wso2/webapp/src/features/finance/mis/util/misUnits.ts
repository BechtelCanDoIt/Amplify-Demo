// Which slice of the business a Build is a Build OF.
//
// Four categories — business units, the software lines, the cloud lines, and a
// set the reader assembles themselves — and the codes under each. Ported from
// `CATEGORY_SUBS`, `defaultAllCode` and `formatUnitLabel` in digiops-finance
// `arrDashboard/components/TableNavigation.js`.
//
// Two vocabularies meet in this file and must not be confused:
//
//   the SELECTION code   `BU_APIM`, and `CUSTOM`. What a link carries as
//                        `unit=bu-apim`, and what the URL contract validates
//                        with `UNIT_CODE_PATTERN`.
//   the BACKEND code     `APIM_BU`. What `/arr-summary` wants in
//                        `businessUnits`, and what `/app-configs` answers with
//                        for the two custom lists.
//
// They are reversed on purpose, and `misArrSummaryRequest.ts` owns the
// translation between them. Everything above `MIS_UNITS_BY_CATEGORY` here is
// the first kind; `formatUnitLabel` alone is about the second.
