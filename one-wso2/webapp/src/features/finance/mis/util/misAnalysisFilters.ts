// What the reader has narrowed ARR Analysis to, and the rules its ten controls
// obey.
//
// Ported from the `filters` state in digiops-finance
// `arrAnalysis/ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:118-131` and the handlers over it.
//
// ---- these are NOT the Build's filters, and not its `MisAppliedFilters` -----
//
// Different set, different endpoints, different lifetime. The Build's applied
// set is serialised into the query string under the contract ticket 02 pinned;
// this one is component state and reaches no address, exactly as in the source.
// A shared ARR Analysis link therefore opens on defaults. That is reproduced
// for parity rather than fixed here: extending the URL contract is a
// contract decision — what an unrecognised value degrades to, what a stale link
// means — and not a side effect of porting a table. It is recorded as an open
// question in spec §11, beside the identical one already standing for the
// Region Summary's cut (§11.11).
//
// ---- on the two words that look interchangeable and are not -----------------
//
// **Business Unit** is the product line a figure is attributed to,
// and it is what the Business Units control selects. **Products in use** is how
// many distinct products an account actually runs, which is a property of the
// ACCOUNT rather than of the figure — the backend sends it as `productsInUse`
// per account and takes `numberOfProductsInUse` as a filter. The source keeps
// them apart in its labels and runs them together in its state, calling the
// first one `products`. This keeps the labels' distinction and drops the
// state's confusion.
