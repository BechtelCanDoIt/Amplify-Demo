// The Scale a reader works in, held across MIS pages and across reloads.
//
// In the source this is a Redux slice, which made it session state that every
// screen could reach. It becomes a context here for the same reason the theme
// did: it is one value, it changes rarely, and the alternative is threading it
// through every Build screen's props.
//
// What this deliberately does NOT own is which Scale is on screen. A link can
// carry `scale=k`, and a link wins — see `useMisScale`, which is the only place
// the two are reconciled. This context answers one question: what did this
// reader last choose?
//
// It lives with the feature rather than in `src/context/`, where the app-wide
// providers are, because Scale is a Finance MIS word (currency in units or
// thousands) and no screen outside MIS has one. `features/tour` holds
// its own provider on the same grounds. What "cross-page" means here is
// cross-MIS-page, and `MisShell` — the frame every MIS screen already renders
// through — is exactly that scope.

/**
 * Namespaced like the app's other browser-stored keys (`one-wso2.theme`,
 * `one-wso2.pinned.v1`) so everything this app writes is greppable.
 *
 * Stores the vocabulary value — `units` / `thousands` — not the URL's `k`. The
 * two are different alphabets on purpose: `k` is a shortening for a link people
 * read, and a stored preference has no such pressure.
