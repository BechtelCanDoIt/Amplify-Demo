// The bodies ARR Analysis sends — `POST /accounts` for the table, and
// `POST /exit-arr/search` for the figure above it.
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrAnalysis/api/arrAnalysisApi.js`:
// `buildBasePayload`, `resolveProducts`, `buildOptionalFilters` and
// `fetchAccounts`. Pure and separate from the hooks, like `misAccountsRequest`
// and `misArrSummaryRequest` before it — this is where the decisions about what
// the backend is TOLD live, and they are testable without one.
//
// ---- why there are two builders and not one with a flag --------------------
//
// The two bodies differ in two places and the differences pull opposite ways.
// `/accounts` asks what the customer book held on ONE DAY, so it carries no
// `startDate`; `/exit-arr/search` asks for a figure over a SPAN, so it carries
// both dates. And `/accounts` omits `businessUnits` at the whole-book default
// where `/exit-arr/search` always names it — which matters for ticket 14 rather
// than here: its per-industry and per-partner-model calls are this same body
// spread over, and they are compared against each other, so every one of them
// has to carry the same unit list or the comparison is between differently
// filtered figures.
//
// Everything they DO share is `optionalFilters`, which is the reader's
// narrowing and is identical in both — asserted, so the table and the figure
// above it can never be answering different questions.
//
// ---- and why `today` is an argument ---------------------------------------
//
// `endDate` is required: the backend answers 400 without one
// (`arr-backend/service.bal:103-112`). So a dismissed As Of Date has to resolve
// to today, and in MIS "today" means Pacific Time rather than the
// viewer's zone, which is what the source uses. Passing it in keeps this module
// free of clocks and lets the fallback be tested on a named day.
