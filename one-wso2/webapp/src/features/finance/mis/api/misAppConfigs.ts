// `GET /app-configs` — what the filter bar's menus are made of.
//
// One call answers for all nine list filters and both custom unit lists. This
// module is the shaping half: the response as the backend declares it, and the
// option lists a control can be handed. `useMisAppConfigs` is the fetch around
// it, so the translation is testable without a backend — the same split as
// `misArrSummaryRequest.ts` and the hook over it.
//
// Ported from the assembly in digiops-finance `arrDashboard/ArrDashboard.js:44-70`
// and the comparator in `arrDashboard/utils/filterOptions.js`. Two of the source's
// decisions there are reproduced deliberately rather than corrected; both are
// marked below, and both are the parity rule's call, not this module's.
