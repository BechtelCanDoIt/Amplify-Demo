// ARR Analysis's two reads: `POST /accounts` for the table, and
// `POST /exit-arr/search` for the figure above it.
//
// Both go through `useColumnQueries` with a list of ONE body, which is the same
// trade `useDrillDownCustomers` makes and for the same reason: this screen has
// no columns, but everything else that engine does is exactly what a POST-that-
// is-a-read needs. The body as the cache key (there is no URL to key on — spec
// §6), sub-scoping so switching accounts in one tab cannot paint the previous
// reader's revenue, `httpRetry`, `humanizeHttpError`, the identity-error fold,
// and a clean idle state while disabled.
//
// ---- what the source does instead, and what is not ported ------------------
//
// `ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:736-805` runs all four of its reads inside one
// 250ms-debounced `useEffect`, guarded by a request-id ref, a JSON-stringified
// "have the filters actually changed" key, and a retry nonce — then
// `Promise.allSettled`s them and copies each result into its own `useState`.
//
// None of that is ported, because React Query already owns every problem it
// solves: the request key IS the body, so an unchanged filter set re-reads
// nothing and the stringified guard has nothing to guard; results arriving out
// of order are the cache's problem rather than a ref's; and a failure is a
// state to read rather than one to copy into another. `allSettled` survives
// here in spirit — the two reads are independent queries, so the figure failing
// leaves the table standing and the other way round.
//
// The debounce IS ported, one level up — see `useDebouncedValue`, which the
// page applies to the filter state feeding all four reads. Ticket 13 dropped it
// on the reasoning that two reads did not justify delaying every deliberate
// click; ticket 14's charts took that to ten and earned it back. It lives over
// the filters rather than in any hook so that all four reads move together.
