// The two breakdowns above the account table, each several reads of the same
// endpoint.
//
// `POST /exit-arr/search` answers with a bare `decimal` and takes one cut per
// call, so a breakdown is not one request returning a series — it is N requests
// returning one figure each. `useColumnQueries` is what fans them out: every
// body is its own cache key, they go in parallel, and a failing one blanks only
// itself.
//
// ---- that last part is a DEVIATION, not the source's behaviour -------------
//
// The source's `Promise.allSettled` is over its FOUR fetches
// (`ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:770-777`), so the table surviving a failed chart is
// its behaviour. Inside each breakdown it is `Promise.all`
// (`arrAnalysisApi.js:254`, `:299`), so **one failing industry read rejects the
// whole breakdown**: `setIndustryBreakdown([])` leaves all six reading as zero,
// under a page-level error banner. Six industries silently worth nothing
// because one request fell over is the same false claim this screen is built to
// refuse, one level up. Here the other five keep their figures and the one that
// failed says so.
//
// ---- what these hooks return, and what they deliberately do not ------------
//
// Neither returns zeros for the calls it did not make. `useAnalysisIndustries`
// hands back the set of industries it ASKED about beside the amounts, and
// `industrySeries` draws no bar for the rest — see `analysisBreakdowns.ts` for
// why a zero and an absence are different answers on this chart.
