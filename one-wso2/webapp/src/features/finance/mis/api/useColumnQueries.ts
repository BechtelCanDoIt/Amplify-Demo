// One POST per Build column — the engine under `useArrSummary` and
// `useCustomerAccounts`.
//
// Both tables are read the same way and it is not a coincidence: a Build column
// is one request, so N columns are N requests. The source runs a hand-rolled
// loop over them guarded by a request-id ref, and both hooks here split them
// instead, which buys three things and costs one:
//
//   + Each column caches under its own body, so widening Years Back re-asks
//     only for the columns whose body actually changed.
//   + A column that fails blanks only itself. That is the source's own error
//     behaviour, but here it falls out of the shape rather than needing a
//     per-column catch inside the loop.
//   + React Query owns the races, so the request-id ref is not ported.
//   − Columns are fetched in parallel rather than in sequence. Recorded as a
//     deviation; if the gateway objects to six concurrent reads,
//     this is the one place to change it for every table at once.
//
// Sub-scoped like every other identity-sensitive query in this app. The figures
// are the same for anyone allowed to see them, but *being allowed* is not:
// switching accounts in one tab must not paint the previous user's revenue.
//
// The callers stay thin and keep their own vocabulary — `response` for a Build
// column, `accounts` for a customer book — because a screen reads better saying
// what it got than saying `data`.
