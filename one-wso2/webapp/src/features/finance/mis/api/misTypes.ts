// Finance MIS's own privilege numbers, read from the MIS ARR backend's
// /user-info and NOWHERE ELSE.
//
// Both numbers already mean something different inside this app, which is the
// whole reason this file exists rather than reusing what is here:
//
//   987  MIS: "may see the ARR dashboards".
//        One WSO2 (appMenu.ts PRIVILEGE.EMPLOYEE): "every authenticated user".
//        leave-app (leaveTypes.ts LEAVE_PRIVILEGE.EMPLOYEE): same.
//   789  MIS: "may see the Flash Dashboard".
//        leave-app (leaveTypes.ts LEAVE_PRIVILEGE.PEOPLE_OPS_TEAM): a People
//        Ops team member.
//
// Only 987 is read here. The Flash Dashboard stays in the MIS app,
// so 789 arrives in the same array and opens nothing in One WSO2 — which is why
// it has no constant below: a name for it would be one step from a check.
//
// Reading MIS access off the shared capability set would therefore hand
// company-wide revenue reporting to every employee in the company. The numbers
// are only meaningful next to the endpoint that issued them, which is why MIS
// has a gate of its own; its backends are left as they are.

// The /user-info body. The Ballerina record declares the five strings as
// `string?`, but the service coalesces every one to "" before returning
// (arr-backend service.bal:63-67, employee.bal:41-47), so they are non-null on
// the wire.
//
// `privileges` is `number[]`, never strings: every consumer matches by numeric
// equality, so a "987" would silently grant nothing and drop the user on an
// empty app with no error.

// (HomePage.js:255-257), and getting it wrong here fails open on a revenue
// screen.
