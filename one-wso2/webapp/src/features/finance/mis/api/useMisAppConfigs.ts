// `GET /app-configs` — the one call behind every menu on the filter bar.
//
// Nine list filters and two custom unit lists, all from one response, fetched
// once and shared: React Query dedupes on the key below, so each control asking
// independently still makes one request. The source achieves the same with a
// Redux slice and a `if (!appConfigs) dispatch(fetch…)` guard on a render
// (`ArrDashboard.js:44-48`) — which is the part of its shell this port deletes.
//
// The lists themselves are not secret in any interesting way, but WHO may ask
// is: this is the same ARR backend that answers /user-info, behind the same
// gateway. So the query is sub-scoped like every other identity-sensitive query
// in this app — switching accounts in one tab must not serve the previous
// user's answer out of cache.
//
// An hour of staleTime rather than the five minutes the figures get. These are
// reference lists — a sales region is not added during a reading session — and
// re-fetching them on every remount of a screen costs a round trip to show a
// menu that has not changed.
