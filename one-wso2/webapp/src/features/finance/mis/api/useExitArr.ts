//
// Ported from `useExitArrByRegion.js` and `useExitArrByBU.js`, which are 404
// and 268 lines. Almost all of what is missing is machinery the port already
// has once: both source hooks carry their own in-flight request cache keyed by
// a stringified payload, their own request-id ref to settle races, and their
// own parser that reads a column's closing date back OUT of the header string
// it was given. Here the columns are `MisDateRange`s to begin with, and
// `useColumnQueries` owns the caching and the races for every MIS table at
// once.
//
// Two of the three are one question asked at two grains — Exit ARR by region,
// Exit ARR in total — and their bodies differ by a single field. Splitting them
// across two files would put that one difference where nobody can see it. The
// third, All ARR Metrics, is a different question over the same regions, and it
// lives here because it shares the column engine and the response coercion and
// because a reader comparing a balance against a movement should not have to
// open two files to do it.
