// `POST /accounts` — the customer book behind the Software/Cloud Customers

//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrDashboard/hooks/useCustomerAccounts.js`,
// which is 584 lines. Most of what is missing here is date arithmetic: that
// hook carries its own Pacific-time period generator for this one table, and
// the port already cuts these ranges once in `misPeriods` for every table. Two
// generators are two places for the customers table and the Build beside it to
// disagree about when a year ended.
//
// The one-request-per-column machinery is `useColumnQueries`, shared with
// `useArrSummary`: same problem, same shape, and a review of this ticket found
// the two hooks were 55 identical lines apart. What is left here is what is
// actually this endpoint's — its bodies, its coercion, and the word `accounts`
// for what a column holds.
//
// ---- one source behaviour is NOT ported ------------------------------------
//
// `useCustomerAccounts.js` calls `setData([])` at the top of every run, with
// the comment "Clear previous data immediately to show loading state". On this
// table that means every filter change empties hundreds of customer rows and
// then re-paints them. React Query holds the previous answer until the next one
// lands, so the figures go stale for a moment instead of going away — which is
// the better failure on a table this tall, and is what the rest of this app
// already does.
