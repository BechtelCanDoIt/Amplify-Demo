/**
 * The list in a response, whatever shape it arrived in.
 *
 * The source writes `Array.isArray(resp) ? resp : (resp?.data || [])` at BOTH
 * list endpoints — `useCustomerAccounts.js:48` and
 * `useArrSummaryCustomers.js:48` — which is the kind of line someone adds after
 * being surprised once. The Ballerina services return bare arrays, so the
 * envelope branch is unreachable against the real backend; it is kept because a
 * gateway between the service and the browser is exactly the thing that would
 * make it reachable, and because the failure it prevents is silent.
 *
 * A bare object would otherwise reach a row builder and be spread into nothing,
 * so the table would show no rows AND no error — the worst of the three
 * possible outcomes.

/**
 * The record in a response, whatever shape it arrived in.
 *
 * The mirror of `arrayIn`, and the shape worth naming is the opposite one: an
 * ARRAY reaching a caller that expects a record gets its INDICES read as field
 * names, so a table grows rows called "0" and "1"; a string — which is what a
 * gateway error page resolves to on a 200 — gets every field read as
 * `undefined`, so the screen draws its headings and no figures and calls that an
 * answer.
 *
 * An empty record instead, which reads everywhere as a call that ANSWERED with
 * nothing — different from one still in flight, and different from one that
 * failed.
 *
 * Callers: the ARR summary, and the two Exit ARR summaries plus the Region
 * Summary's movement view (`useExitArr`). (The Flash reads that also used it
 * were removed with the Flash Dashboard, which stays in the MIS app.)
