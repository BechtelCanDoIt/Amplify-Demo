// `POST /arr-summary/customers` — the customers behind one figure in the Build.
//
// ONE request, not one per column, which is why this reads oddly beside its two
// neighbours: `useColumnQueries` takes a LIST of bodies and this passes a list
// of one. That is the right trade rather than a fresh hook — everything the
// drill-down needs from it is the part that has nothing to do with columns: the
// body as the cache key, the sub-scoping, `httpRetry`, `humanizeHttpError`, the
// identity-error fold, and the clean idle state when there is nothing to ask.
//
// `null` request means the dialog is shut: no body, no query, no fetch. That
// yields the engine's idle state — except when the SUBJECT itself has failed,
// which is reported ahead of it. Harmless here because the page unmounts the
// dialog when nothing is open, but worth knowing before reading this state
// anywhere else.
//
// ---- the source's error handling is BROKEN, and this does not copy it -------
//
// Three times over. `http.js:65` hands the failure callback a STRING, so
// `useArrSummaryCustomers.js:52` reading `err?.message` off it always falls
// through to the literal 'Failed'; and `DataGrid.js:911` never destructures
// `error` at all, so the dialog has no error prop and no error state. A failed
// drill-down there renders an EMPTY GRID, indistinguishable from "no customers
// matched" — on a screen whose whole purpose is to explain a figure. The
// backend does send a usable message. This surfaces it.
