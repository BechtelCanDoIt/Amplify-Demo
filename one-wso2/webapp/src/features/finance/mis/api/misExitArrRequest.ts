// The bodies of the three `POST /arr-summary/*` summary calls — `region-exit`
// and `bu-exit` behind the two Exit ARR summaries, and `region-metrics` behind
// the Region Summary's All ARR Metrics view — one per column.
//
// Ported from `buildPayload` in digiops-finance
// `arrDashboard/hooks/useExitArrByRegion.js` and `useExitArrByBU.js`. The two
// are identical but for `isSalesRegionSummary`, which is why they are one
// module here and two functions rather than one function with a flag that could
// be forgotten.
//
// ---- why this body is the narrowest of the four ----------------------------
//
// `/arr-summary` sends eighteen fields, `/accounts` three; these send four or
// five. The nine account and geography lists are not forwarded at all, and on
// the two Exit ARR summaries `businessUnits` is hard-coded to every unit.
//
// That is the shape of the question rather than an omission. An Exit ARR
// summary reports what every business unit was worth across every region, so
// the per-unit breakdown IS the table's columns and the per-region breakdown IS
// its rows. Narrowing to one unit would leave six of seven figures empty under
// a heading still promising all of them.
//
// All ARR Metrics is the exception, and it is the exception for exactly that
// reason: its columns are the seven MOVEMENTS rather than the seven units, so
// nothing is spent on the unit split and the reader's selection is free to
// narrow the question. It is the one summary whose body carries it.
//
// ---- a summary is a BALANCE, and a Build is a MOVEMENT ----------------------
//
// Both still send two dates, and the pair means the same thing it does for a
// Build: `endDate` closes the column and `startDate` is the balance it is read
// forward from. What is absent is `prevColDateRange` — there are no y/y rows in
// a summary to compare against — and `isFirstColumn`, which only a forecast
// roll-forward needs.
