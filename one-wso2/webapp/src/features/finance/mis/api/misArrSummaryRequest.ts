// The bodies of the `POST /arr-summary` calls one Build needs — one per column.
//
// Ported from the fetch loop in digiops-finance
// `arrDashboard/hooks/useArrTableSummary.js`. Pulled out as a pure function
// because it is where the port's arithmetic actually lives: which dates a
// column covers, which column it is compared against, and which of the Applied
// filters the backend is told about. The hook around it (`useArrSummary`) is
// then only plumbing, and this is testable without a backend.
//
// Dates cross over here. A Period range is written `yyyy/MM/dd`, because that is
// what the grids and the Excel export show; the wire wants `yyyy-MM-dd`. The
// source converts at the same boundary and so does this.
