// ARR by industry — six named industries and whatever else the book holds.
//
// ---- horizontal bars, one hue ----------------------------------------------
//
// Two form decisions, both from the `dataviz` skill.
//
// **Horizontal**, because the categories have long names. "Health Care and
// Social Assistance" does not fit under a vertical bar. Turned sideways the
// names are simply read left to right.
//
// **One hue for every bar**, because these are NOMINAL categories and the
// measure is magnitude. Colouring each bar by its own value would double-encode
// what bar length already shows and spend the identity channel on nothing; the
// skill names that one outright ("Bad: a value-ramp on nominal categories").
// One series also means no legend box — the title names it.
//
// ---- and the thing this chart will NOT claim -------------------------------
//
// An industry the backend did not offer is never asked about, and gets no bar
// at all rather than a zero one. A zero bar would state "this industry holds
// no ARR" on the strength of a question nobody put.
// `analysisBreakdowns.ts` keeps the two apart; this renders the distinction.
