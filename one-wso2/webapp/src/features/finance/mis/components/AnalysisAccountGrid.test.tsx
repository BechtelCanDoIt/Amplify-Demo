// Vitest's 5s default is the wrong one for this file. Every test here mounts a
// real MUI component that is expensive in jsdom — the DataGrid's first mount,
// or an Autocomplete opening its listbox — and under the full suite's
// parallelism those legitimately run past five seconds while taking about two
// on their own. Nothing here waits on a timer or a network, so a timeout is
// always machine load rather than a hang, and a test that fails by luck is
// worse than a slow one. Several of this repo's other grid-heavy suites sit in
// the same place and fail intermittently; this one says so instead.

// The account table, and the one thing about it that is worth more than every
// other assertion here: **what its CSV actually contains.**
//
// The Excel workbook has no Scale parameter, so an unscaled export is
// structural there. The DataGrid's CSV has no such layer — it is the component's own,
// and it takes each cell's `formattedValue`, which is `valueFormatter`'s output
// when a column has one. So a money column that formatted through
// `valueFormatter` would export the READER'S SCALE: a file 1000x off, with
// nothing in it saying so, on the screen whose whole output is a spreadsheet.
//
// These columns format in `renderCell` and pin `valueFormatter` to the identity,
// so the cell's value reaches the CSV untouched. Pinning rather than omitting,
// because a column typed `number` is fitted with `toLocaleString` whether or
// not anyone asked — so "no formatter" is not a state this column can be in.
//
// None of that is enforced structurally, so it is asserted HERE, on the bytes
// the exporter writes, the same way the workbook test reads the file back.
