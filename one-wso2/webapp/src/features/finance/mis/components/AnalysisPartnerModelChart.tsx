// ARR by partner model — how much of the book is sold through Channel and how
// much Direct.
//
// ---- this is a PROPORTION BAR, not a two-slice pie -------------------------
//
// Deliberate, and it is the one form decision on this screen. A pie of exactly
// two slices is something the `dataviz` skill names outright as not to draw
// ("Bad: a one-bar bar chart, or a 2-slice pie"), and its form table routes
// part-to-whole to a stacked bar. Two segments in a circle make the reader
// compare angles to answer a question a single bar answers by length.
//
// When one model holds all the ARR the bar is already the right shape, so the
// same form covers both the split and the single-model case.
//
// No figure moves. Parity protects the numbers Finance reconciles column by
// column, and those are in the companion table below, to the cent.
//
// ---- colour is by ENTITY, never by rank ------------------------------------
//
// Channel is always slot 1 and Direct always slot 2, whichever is larger. A
// view where Direct overtakes Channel must not repaint both of them — that is
// the one rule that makes two screenshots comparable. The slots come from
// `chartPalette`, validated against this app's own surfaces in both modes.
