// The two Exit ARR summaries: what their rows are, and which figure each cell
// reads.
//
// Ported from `mapResponseToRows` in digiops-finance
// `arrDashboard/hooks/useExitArrByRegion.js` and `useExitArrByBU.js`, and from
// `generateBuOnlyColumns` in `arrDashboard/utils/tableConstants.js`.
//
// ---- one record, read two ways ---------------------------------------------
//
// Both endpoints answer with the ARR backend's `BuType` — five business units,
// Moesif, and a total (`arr-backend/modules/types/types.bal:372`). What differs
// is the shape around it: `/bu-exit` answers with ONE, and `/region-exit`
// answers with a MAP of them keyed by region. So the two tables read the same
// seven numbers and disagree only about what a row is.
//
// That also settles which table's rows come from the code and which from the
// data. A business unit is a thing this repo knows the name of, so BU Summary's
// seven rows are a constant. A region is not — the backend cuts by Sales Region
// or Sub Region depending on what it was asked, and the list of either is a
// property of the customer book — so Region Summary's rows are whatever the
// responses named.
//
// ---- the source's defensive reader is NOT ported ---------------------------
//
// `useExitArrByRegion.js`'s `pickBuNumbers` tries four key spellings in turn
// (`apim`, `apimBuTotal`, `APIM`, then nested under `bu` or `businessUnit`) and
// accepts the response as an array, or under `data`, `result` or `payload`.
// None of those shapes is what the service returns, and a reader that accepts
// five shapes cannot tell a changed contract from an empty one: every wrong
// guess lands on the same silent zeroes. This reads the contract, and a body
// that is not it shows nothing rather than nothing-shaped-like-figures.
