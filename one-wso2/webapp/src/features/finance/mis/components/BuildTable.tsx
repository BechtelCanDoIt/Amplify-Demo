// The grid's visual rules, in one place (the values are `buildTableSx.ts`):
//
//   - an Oxygen `ListingTable` at compact density, so text size, weights, cell
//     padding and the head's fill are the same as every other table in the
//     app; row and header heights follow from that, and nothing here sets one
//   - ONE header row when each Period has a single figure column (the
//     sub-header row only exists with several)
//   - no vertical rules between figures — only the pinned column's and the
//     header's
//   - a section row is a band on `grey.50` (light) / `action.hover` (dark)
//     with a small-caps label, and it is a label, not a fold: no chevron, no
//     toggle, no indent, and every row of every section is always on screen
//   - bold rows at weight 600, no fill under them and no rule above Ending ARR
//   - a drill-down figure shows its underline only to a pointer or the keyboard
//   - negatives carry their sign and nothing else — no colour

// The table every Build screen renders through.
//
// A Build reads down — an Opening balance, the movements that change it, a
// Closing balance — and across, one column group per Period. Four things have
// to be true at once, and it is the combination rather than any one of them
// that decided this is hand-rolled over Oxygen's table primitives rather than
// a data grid:
//
//   1. the row-label column stays put while two dozen numeric columns scroll
//   2. the header stays put while the rows scroll under it
//   3. the header is TWO rows — a Period above its Amount / % Open pair
//   4. section rows are bands labelling the rows beneath them, drawn in the
//      same table as the figures they head
//
// (3) is the one with no precedent anywhere in this repo and no help from MUI.
// See `useHeaderRowHeight` below.
//
// What this component does NOT do, deliberately: no formatting (injected, so
// the Scale rule stays in one place) and no fetching.
//
// It DOES window its rows above `ROW_WINDOW_THRESHOLD` (see `useRowWindow`), and
// it DOES render a figure as an activatable control when the caller's `cell`
// returns an `onActivate` — which is how the customer drill-down opens. What

 * where the offset is not configurable — so with two header rows the second
 * lands on top of the first and the Period labels disappear behind the Amount /
 * % Open pair that belongs to them. Row 2 needs `top: <height of row 1>`, MUI
 * offers no API for it, and there is no column-group primitive in the package
 * either.
 *
 * A constant would be wrong the first time anything moved: the density, the
 * font, a Period label long enough to wrap, or a reader at anything other than
 * 100% zoom, where the true height is fractional and rounding it leaves either
 * a hairline gap or an overlap. So it is measured, and used as measured.
 *
 * The measuring itself is `useMeasuredValue`'s, which is where the
 * `ResizeObserver`-under-jsdom reasoning now lives; this hook is the question
 * asked of it, and the paragraphs above are why the question has to be asked at
 * all rather than answered with a constant.
 *
 * The height is state, so settling it re-renders the table — once on mount, and
 * again whenever the header row genuinely changes size. That is bounded, and it
 * is why the windowing below is measured in RENDERS rather than in rows: every
 * such render asks the `cell` function for every figure on screen again, and
