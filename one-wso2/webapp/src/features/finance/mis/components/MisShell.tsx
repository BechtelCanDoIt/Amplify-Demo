// Shared page frame for every Finance MIS screen: a title and subtitle, and —
// the reason this exists — ONE place that owns every degraded
// state, so no screen has to remember them and none of them differs:
//
//   1. ARR backend URL not set    → say which config key is missing
//   2. a prerequisite of THIS screen is still in flight → spinner
//   3. that prerequisite failed   → an error with a retry
//   4. /user-info still in flight → spinner, never a premature denial
//   5. /user-info failed          → an error with a retry, NOT a denial
//   6. cannot open THIS screen    → a locked door
//
// Rungs 5 and 6 are the pair worth keeping apart; see MisGate.isError.
//
// ---- what a `prerequisite` is, and why it is a rung rather than a caller's
//      early return --------------------------------------------------------
//
// One screen needs something answered BEFORE the gate's answer means anything:
// ARR Analysis exists only while `productsUsageEnabled` is true, and that
// arrives from GET /app-configs rather than from /user-info. Until it does,
// `canSee("mis-analysis")` is false for a reason that is not a refusal — so
// without this rung every cold load of that screen flashes a locked panel at
// someone who is about to be let in.
//
// It goes ABOVE the gate for that reason, and it lives here rather than in the
// page because this file exists to be the one place a degraded state is worded.
// A page handling it with early returns would render a spinner and an error
// with no heading above either, which is what the header below is for.
//
// ---- how this differs from MarketingOpsShell ------------------------------
//
// That shell asks one question — are you authorized for this perspective — and
// every screen behind it follows. This one takes a `gateId` and asks per screen,
// because one screen has a condition of its own: ARR Analysis exists only while
// its `productsUsageEnabled` flag is on. The Builds share the ARR privilege;
// Analysis is the screen with a condition of its own.
//
// ---- and why it checks the ARR key specifically ---------------------------
//
// /user-info lives on the ARR service, so an unset ARR URL means no MIS screen
// can establish who you are.
