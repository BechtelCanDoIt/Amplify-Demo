// the Region Summary's View, and the customer table's Breakdown. Each of them
// chooses between two arrangements of a table the reader is already looking at,
// none of them is in the URL, and all three
// were the same twenty lines with different words in them.

// It stays a presentational control and holds no state: what the choices mean,

// questions, and they differ at each of the three call sites.
//
// Drawn as an uppercase 12px/700 label beside the same segments the Period row
// uses, so the two controls read as one family.
