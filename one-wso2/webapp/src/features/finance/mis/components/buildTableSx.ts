// The Build table's style decisions, as data.
//
// They live here rather than inline for the reason `financeGridSx.ts` already
// records: jsdom does not resolve an emotion-injected rule through
// `getComputedStyle`, so a rendered assertion about a `:hover` or a sticky
// offset passes just as happily with the rule deleted. Hand-rolling leaves three
// mechanisms this table has to own forever and none of them is decorative, so
// each one is a value a test can hold still — and `BuildTable.test.tsx` also
// checks that the component uses them, because a constant nothing reads is
// worth nothing.
//
// ---- why any of this is hand-rolled at all --------------------------------
//
// The community `@mui/x-data-grid` this app ships cannot express a
// Build — no column pinning, no row grouping, `pageSize` throws above 100. So
// the table is Oxygen's `ListingTable` — the same component as the rest of the
// app's tables, which is where its text size, weights, cell padding and head
// fill come from — and these are the pieces that component declines to
// provide: the frozen pane, the two-row header's offset, the opaque composites
// under anything sticky, and the per-cell row highlight.
