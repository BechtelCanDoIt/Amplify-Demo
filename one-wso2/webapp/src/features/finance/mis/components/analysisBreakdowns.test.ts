// The thing both of these are really about is **the difference between a zero
// and an absence**, which the source does not draw anywhere. `POST
// /exit-arr/search` is asked once per industry, but only for industries the
// backend actually offers — the rest are reported as `revenue: 0` with no
// request made (`arrAnalysisApi.js:266-299`). So a zero bar in the source can
// mean "this industry holds no ARR" or "nobody asked", and the chart states the
// first either way.
