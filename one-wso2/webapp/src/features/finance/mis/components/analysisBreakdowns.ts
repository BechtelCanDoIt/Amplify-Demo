// What the two breakdowns above the account table are made of, as data.
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrAnalysis/analysisFormat.js`
// (`partnerModelSlices`, which that app already has under test) and the
// `industrySeries` memo in `ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:857-877`.
//
// Shaping only — no colours, no marks, no components. The charts read these,
// and so do the companion tables beneath them, which is what keeps the picture
// and the figures beside it from being computed two different ways.
//
// ---- the distinction the source does not draw ------------------------------
//
// **A zero and an absence are different answers, and this module keeps them
// apart.** `POST /exit-arr/search` is asked once per industry, but only for
// industries `GET /app-configs` actually offers; the rest are reported as
// `revenue: 0` with no request made (`arrAnalysisApi.js:266-299`). So a zero bar
// in the source can mean "this industry holds no ARR" or "nobody asked", and the
// chart asserts the first either way. Ticket 14's checklist calls this out as
// the thing that decides what the charts can honestly claim.
//
// Here an industry that was never asked about has `amount: undefined` and
// `asked: false`, and the chart draws no bar for it. It also suppresses
// **Other** — see `industrySeries`.

/**
 * The six industries the source charts, in its order
 * (`ArrAnalysisDashboard.js:64-71`, `INDUSTRY_CHART_ORDER`).
 *
 * Written down rather than read from `GET /app-configs`, because the chart's
 * shape is fixed: six named bars plus Other. The backend's industry list is
 * longer and varies, and is what the Industry FILTER offers.
 *
 * The order is the source's and is kept deliberately, where sorting by amount
 * would arguably read better as a ranking. A fixed order is stable across
 * filter changes, so a reader comparing two narrowings is comparing bars in the
 * same places rather than re-finding each industry; and it is what the running
 * app shows during the parallel period.
