// The Region Summary's `All ARR Metrics` view: what its rows are, what its
// columns are, and which field each figure is read from.
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrDashboard/hooks/useArrSummaryRegionMetrics.js`
// (`mapResponseToRows`) and `arrDashboard/components/RegionMetricsTable.js`
// (`getRegionMetricsColumnDefs`).
//
// ---- it is the Exit ARR summary's opposite, and that explains the rest ------
//
// Exit ARR by Region is a BALANCE: one figure per region, split seven ways by
// business unit. This is the MOVEMENT of that balance: seven figures per
// region — Opening, First Sale, Expansion, Reduction, Loss, Net New, Closing —
// cut by ONE business unit at a time. So:
//
//   * the columns are the Build's `{opening} - {end}` spans and not
//     `As of {end}`, because a movement covers a period rather than closing one;
//   * the business unit NARROWS the question rather than breaking it out, which
//     is why this is the one summary whose body carries the reader's unit
//     selection instead of hard-coding `ALL_BU`;
//   * and the seven columns are the same under every Period, exactly as the
//     Exit ARR summary's seven units are.
//
// The rows are the two tables' one shared problem, and they are solved in one
// place: see `util/misRegions.ts`.
