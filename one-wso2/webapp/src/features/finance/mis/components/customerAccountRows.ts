// The Software/Cloud Customers table: what its rows are, what its columns are,
// and which field each figure is read from.
//
// Ported from digiops-finance `arrDashboard/hooks/useCustomerAccounts.js`
// (`transformApiData`) and `arrDashboard/utils/tableConstants.js`
// (`generateCloudBusinessUnitColumns`).
//
// ---- this table is the Subscription Build turned on its side ---------------
//
// The Subscription Build is 34 rows whatever the backend returns: every row is
// a named metric line and the figures arrive as COLUMNS. Here the rows ARE the
// data — one per account in the customer book, hundreds per business unit — and
// the metric breakdown is what arrives as columns. So this is the table the
// row windowing was actually written for, and the first one where the
// row count is a question about the data rather than about the code.
//
// ---- the port does NOT keep the source's flattened field names -------------
//
// The source flattens everything onto one wide object per account, keyed by a
// string built from the period label: `2025_01_01___2025_12_31_cloud_total`.
// That is how ag-grid wants its rows, and it means a renamed column header
// silently renames a data key. Here the column identity is a `key` on the
// sub-column and the figure is looked up by it, so the header text and the data
// path are separate things and a relabelled column cannot lose its figures.
//
// One dead field is deliberately not ported: `transformApiData` writes an
// `open_banking` value from `openBankingSoftwareTotal`, and no column
// definition anywhere reads it. Porting it would carry a column the source has
// not shown for as long as its own header list has existed.
