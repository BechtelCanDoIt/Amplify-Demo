// The shape of a Build table, with no DOM in it.
//
// A Build reads down: an Opening balance, the movements that change it, a
// Closing balance — and across: one column group per Period, each holding the
// same few sub-columns. `BuildTable.tsx` renders that; this decides what is on
// screen, how wide it has to be, and what the header cells are called.
//
// Kept apart from the component because both halves are things a test can hold
// still. Which rows a collapsed section hides is logic, and logic that only
// exists inside a render can only be tested by rendering. And the `id`/`headers`
// wiring is a set of strings that must agree across three places in the markup;
// agreement between strings is exactly what a unit test is for.

/** One Period, spanning its sub-columns in the header's first row. */

 * usually would: there is no virtualization yet (ticket 07), so a row that is
 * hidden but still rendered is a row still being paid for.
 *
 * The set names what is OPEN, not what is closed, so that a Build opens as the
 * summary it is meant to be — the balances and the movements between them — and
 * stays that way when rows arrive. Naming what is closed would mean seeding the
 * set from the tree, and a tree that is empty on the first render (because the
 * fetch has not landed) would seed nothing and then blow every section open

 * ---- why this is arithmetic and not `react-window` -------------------------
 *
 * Ticket 07 says to reach for `react-window` before writing anything bespoke,
 * and it is a dependency already. It cannot do this job. `createListComponent`
 * hands every item `{ position: 'absolute', top, height, width: '100%' }`
 * (`react-window@1.8.11`, `dist/index.esm.js:1099-1106`), and that style is not
 * optional — it is how the library places rows. An absolutely positioned `<tr>`
 * leaves the table formatting context, which takes with it the four things
 * a hand-rolled `<table>` was chosen to keep: the column widths the table
 * algorithm computes across header and body, the `position: sticky` row-label
 * column, the sticky two-row header, and the `id`/`headers` wiring that is the
 * only way a screen reader can say which Period a figure belongs to. The
 * library's own table examples avoid this by dropping `<table>` for
 * `display: block` divs, which is the trade the port already refused.
 *
 * What is left is the part react-window would have contributed anyway: an
 * index range from a scroll offset. That is this function, it is nine lines,
 * and it is exact rather than approximate. The rows stay real `<tr>`s in a real
 * `<tbody>` and every mechanism above keeps working untouched.
