// The two vocabularies are unrelated. people-app numbers LEAD 993 / ADMIN 999;
// the leave backend numbers LEAD 879 / PEOPLE_OPS_TEAM 789, returned by its own
// /user-info. Reading `requires` against people-app capabilities meant a leave
// lead who is not a people-app lead saw no Reports entry while the page worked
// by URL, and a people-app lead who is not a leave lead saw the entry and
// landed on a denial. Same shape of problem as Finance and Marketing Ops, and
// the same treatment — see useFinanceGate.
//
// The source enforces this at the ROUTE, building its router from a role table
// so an ineligible user gets a 404 (route.ts:129-149, AppHandler.tsx:46). We do
// the same: `canSee` gates the rail entry, the tab in the bar, AND the tab's
// route, from this one mapping — so the menu, the tab bar and the screen cannot
// disagree, and a tab that is hidden cannot be reached by typing its URL.
