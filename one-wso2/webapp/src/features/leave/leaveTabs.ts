// The Leave app's shape: ONE rail entry, tabs named for what you are doing,
// and the kind of leave chosen inside the tab.
//
// This is the source's own nesting — route.ts:47-150 has Apply → General |
// Sabbatical, and so on across its four action routes. The first port
// inverted it, one rail entry per KIND, to keep the everyday path away from
// the rare one. That worked, at the price of two rail rows where three of the
// eight tabs repeated a name (Apply, My history, Report) and a sabbatical that
// an ordinary employee uses twice a career sat level with general leave.
//
// Folding back to the source's order costs nothing in the screens themselves:
// every tab body is already a zero-prop component, and the two history tabs
// already share one `HistoryBody`. The kind is a route segment rather than
// component state because the gate is enforced at the ROUTE — hiding a toggle
// is not access control, and a typed URL has to be refused the same way.
