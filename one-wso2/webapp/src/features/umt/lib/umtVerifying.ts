// "no pull request provided" would let it slip through alongside a reason,
// which the exclusive-or rule is meant to forbid, and would let it ride along
// in the submitted list unvalidated.
//
// `publicPullRequests` are the ones entered now and must each be a wso2 public
// PR. `existingPullRequests` were saved earlier — possibly before that rule —
// so they count towards having a PR but aren't re-checked: a stored link the
// dialog can't edit must not block completion for good.
