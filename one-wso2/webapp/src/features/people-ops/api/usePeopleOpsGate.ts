// Authorization gate for the People Ops reports. Same three-state contract
// as useMarketingOpsGate (resolving / error / decided) so PeopleOpsShell can
// render the same careful sequence — but far simpler underneath: Marketing
// Ops has to ask its own backend's /api/me, whereas every fact this gate
// needs is already in the app-wide /user-info query, so this adds no request.
//
// The reports are ADMIN-only, and that is enforced by the BACKEND: both
// POST /employees/search (in its org-wide, non-leadOnly form) and
// POST /reports/employees/generate reject non-admins with 403. This gate
// exists so an unauthorized caller sees an explanation instead of a failed
// request — it is not the security boundary and must never be treated as one.
