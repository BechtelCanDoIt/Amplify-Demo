// Shared page frame for the People Ops report screens. Same role and same
// state ladder as MarketingOpsShell — deliberately, so the two perspectives
// degrade identically rather than each inventing its own vocabulary:
//
//   1. backend URL not set     → name the missing config key
//   2. /user-info in flight    → spinner, never a premature denial
//   3. /user-info failed       → an error with a retry, NOT a denial
//   4. decided: not an admin   → say plainly that access is missing
//
// Keeping 3 and 4 apart is the point of the ladder. Collapsing them tells
// someone whose request merely timed out that they lack a privilege, and
// sends them off chasing an Asgardeo group they already hold.
//
// The reports are ADMIN-only in the backend (both POST /employees/search in
// its org-wide form and POST /reports/employees/generate return 403). This
// shell is UX, not enforcement: it explains the 403 that would otherwise
// arrive as a bare error, and it must not be mistaken for the access control.
//
// `requireAdmin` defaults on; a future People Ops page that is genuinely open
// to everyone can opt out without reimplementing states 1–3.
