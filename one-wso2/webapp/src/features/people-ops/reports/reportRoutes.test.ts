    // route lives, so checking only the top level would miss it entirely.
    //
    // Org Chart is one deliberate exception — same people-app backend, a
    // different endpoint with its own access model (any employee in that
    // endpoint's configured group, not a people-app admin privilege). See
    // the comment above PEOPLE_OPS_SECTIONS.
    //
    // The two Subscriptions screens are the others, and for a different
    // reason worth keeping straight from Org Chart's. They do not talk to
    // people-app at all: they gate on the SUBSCRIPTION service's own Asgardeo
    // groups, whose names that service publishes on /subscriptions/meta-info.
    // `requires: ["admin"]` would be actively wrong on them — a People Ops
    // admin is not a commute or LaaS admin, so it would advertise the manage
    // screen to the wrong people AND hide it from the right ones. The rail and
    // the overview card both route these ids through useSubscriptionGate
    // instead; see SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM_IDS.
    //
    // Note what this leaves unguarded: nothing checks here that those two ids
    // ARE in SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM_IDS, so the next assertion does that — dropping
    // an id from both places would otherwise look like a passing test.
    //
    // The two PAR entries are a third kind of exception: par-app has its own
    // role model (team lead / admin), unrelated to people-app's generic
    // "admin" capability. `requires: ["admin"]` would be wrong here the same
    // way it would on Subscriptions — a People Ops admin isn't necessarily a
    // PAR admin or a team lead, and vice versa. The rail routes these two
    // through ParRequiresTeamLeadRoute/ParRequiresAdminRoute instead (see
    // perspectives.ts's own comment above the PAR group) — that each one
    // actually reaches its gate and redirects a non-lead/non-admin away is
    // asserted in ParLeadTabRouting.test.tsx/ParAdminTabRouting.test.tsx,
    // not here.
    //
    // promotion-lead-portal and promotion-team-history are the same shape
    // of exception as the two PAR ones: promotion-app has its own
    // Role.LEAD, read back from its own GET /employee-privileges, unrelated
    // to people-app's "admin" capability. Gated via PromotionRequiresLeadRoute
    // + PROMOTION_LEAD_PORTAL_ITEM_ID/PROMOTION_TEAM_HISTORY_ITEM_ID (see
    // perspectives.ts's own comment above the Promotion section) rather
    // than `requires`. promotion-functional-lead-portal,
    // promotion-board-portal, and promotion-admin-portal are the same shape
    // again, on Role.FUNCTIONAL_LEAD, Role.PROMOTION_BOARD_MEMBER, and
    // Role.HR_ADMIN respectively. promotion-cycle-history is the odd one
    // out: gated on isHrAdmin OR isFunctionalLead, the only two-role gate
    // among this section's children (see perspectives.ts's own comment
    // above it).
    //
    // banking-admin is the same shape of exception as the PAR/Promotion ones
    // above: gated on the banking backend's own GET /employee-privileges via
