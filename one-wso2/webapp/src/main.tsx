// Oxygen's typography asks for "Inter Variable" but the library does not
// actually load it, despite its README claiming otherwise — so every app that
// trusts that claim renders in the platform system font instead. Import the
// face here; the
// package is already in the tree as an @wso2/oxygen-ui dependency, and the
// build-time CSP already allows font-src 'self'. Imported by explicit .css
// path so it type-checks as a stylesheet side-effect import (the package ships
// no type declarations, and noUncheckedSideEffectImports is on).
