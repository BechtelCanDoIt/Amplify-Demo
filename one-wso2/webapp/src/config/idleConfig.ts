// Idle-session handling.
//
// The timer and the "still there?" dialog ALWAYS run: after 25 minutes of
// inactivity the dialog appears and waits to be answered. One config key,
// `ONE_WSO2_IDLE_AUTO_SIGN_OUT`, decides what happens if it is ignored:
//
//   off (default) — nothing. The dialog sits there until answered and the
//                   session survives.
//   on            — the session ends at the 30-minute mark.
//
// Note what "off" costs: it does not satisfy threat-model risk ONEWSO2-R1, which
// wants an idle timeout under 30 minutes. A dialog is not a timeout — it can be
// left unanswered indefinitely, with the page still on screen behind it.
// Deployments that need R1 must set the flag.
//
// Why "off" is nonetheless the default, rather than opt-out:
//
// Signing out here is not a local operation. It calls Asgardeo's `signOut()`,
// which is OIDC RP-initiated logout — a redirect through the IdP's end-session
// endpoint that terminates the shared Asgardeo session, not just this app's
// tokens. (The `?state=sign_out_success` landing the AuthGuard has to scrub is
// that round trip.) So an idle timer here does not quietly log you out of One
// WSO2; it logs you out of Asgardeo, and every other WSO2 app on that session
// then demands a fresh sign-in. Defaulting that on would mean one app being
// idle re-authenticates the user everywhere, which is the wrong trade for an
// internal suite people keep open in tabs all day.
//
// Closing this properly needs a sign-out that clears app session state without
// ending the IdP session, so re-entry is a silent re-auth rather than a
// credential prompt. Until that exists, R1 stays an explicit per-deployment
// opt-in and the dialog carries the reminder.
