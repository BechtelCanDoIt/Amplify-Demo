// ---- marketing-ops backend -------------------------------------------------
//
// The Marketing Ops backend (digiops-marketing/agents/marketing-ops) is a
// Python/FastAPI service — the first non-Ballerina backend this app talks to —
// and it stays exactly as it is: this perspective is a frontend migration only.
//
// Two things differ from every sibling above, both worth knowing before adding
// an endpoint:
//
//  1. Its routes are namespaced under `/api/*`, and the Choreo proxy PRESERVES
//     that prefix, so every URL here carries it. Verified 2026-08-17 against
//     staging: `/api/me` → 200, `/me` → 404.
//  2. It authenticates purely from the gateway's `x-jwt-assertion` header and
//     never inspects the Asgardeo token itself, so the standard authedGet /
//     authedPost helpers work unmodified — no per-backend header quirk like
//     par-app's `x-user-timezone-offset`.
//
// A router with no root route 404s on its own prefix (`/api/settings` and
// `/api/events` both do) — always name the sub-path.
//
// Empty string = not configured; MarketingOpsShell renders a "not connected"
// state rather than firing broken requests.
// Trailing slashes stripped, because every builder below concatenates "/api/..."
// onto this — a configured value ending in "/" produced "//api/..." on all 52 of
// them, and whether that 404s depends on the gateway.

// issuer and both apps share one, so it would overwrite the first.

//     /v1.0.
//
//  3. Trailing slashes are stripped, as they are for marketing-ops. The
