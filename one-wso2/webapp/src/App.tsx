              perspective and would render its rail around a MIS screen.

              All four screens are routed, and each joined the registry in the
              same change that gave it a route — the rail renders every visible
              child of a group whether or not it carries a path, so an entry
              without one is a row that silently does nothing.

              Access is NOT enforced here: MisShell asks useMisGate, so typing a
              URL you may not use gives a legible locked state rather than a
              redirect that leaves the reader guessing.

              ARR Analysis is the one exception, and it is a different question.
              `productsUsageEnabled` decides whether that screen EXISTS rather
              than who may read it, so with the flag off its route redirects to
              ARR Build — see MisArrAnalysisPage, which holds the redirect
              itself so that a flag not yet known is neither. */}

              has to outlive any one

              lose the reader's Years Back on the way over, which is precisely
              the journey the value exists for. Quarterly and Monthly default to
              1 where Annually defaults to 5, so a missed route shows up as a

              the People Ops and
              Finance path prefixes, same reason Due Diligence's own routes
              do above: a screen reachable from two different rails can't
              itself live under either one's own prefix. BankingAdminRoute
              is the "any admin at all" gate; BankingAdminTabRoute is the
              finer per-tab split (Change Requests is People-Ops-only). */}
