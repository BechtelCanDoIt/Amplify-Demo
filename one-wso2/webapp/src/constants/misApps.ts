// Registry of the Finance MIS screens, surfaced inside the Finance
// perspective. Ported from digiops-finance/apps/mis.
//
// ---- why its own file, and not financeApps.ts -----------------------------
//
// The port spec says "one MenuApp in FINANCE_PERSPECTIVE_APPS", and putting it
// there literally would break the gating. That constant feeds FINANCE_ITEM_IDS,
// which is how usePerspectiveVisibility decides to ask useFinanceGate — the
// gate for the three claim backends, which knows nothing about MIS privileges
// and would answer for every MIS id by falling through to its open default. So
// MIS gets its own registry and its own id set, exactly as Marketing Ops does,
// and is spread into the Finance perspective's sections where it is surfaced.
//
// ---- on `requires` --------------------------------------------------------
//
// `requires` takes One WSO2 capabilities, which are derived from people-app
// privilege numbers and bear no relation to MIS's own. Every entry here says
// `["admin"]` to mean RESTRICTED, nothing more — useMisGate makes the real
// decision against the MIS ARR backend's /user-info. The same convention, and
// the same reason, as marketingOpsApps.ts.
//
// This is not belt-and-braces, it is load-bearing: MIS privilege 987 is the
// same number as One WSO2's PRIVILEGE.EMPLOYEE, which every signed-in user
// holds. An MIS item that reached `sectionAllowed(requires, caps)` would be
// visible to the whole company.
