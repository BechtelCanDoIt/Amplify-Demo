// Registry of the Marketing Ops operations and their top-level menu items,
// surfaced inside the One WSO2 Marketing Ops perspective. Same model as
// FINANCE_APPS — one MenuApp per operation, its sub-screens as items — and for
// the same reason: the left rail (via appsToSections in @constants/perspectives),
// the waffle and the overview page all derive from this one array, so they
// cannot drift apart.
//
// Transcribed from the Marketing Ops frontend's own operation registry and
// routes (digiops-marketing/agents/marketing-ops/frontend), which already
// splits operations into sub-routes the same way (/operations/events/mine,
// /operations/events/review).
//
// ---- on `requires` -------------------------------------------------------
//
// `requires` takes One WSO2 capabilities (employee/lead/serviceDesk/admin),
// which are derived from people-app privilege numbers and have NOTHING to do
// with Marketing Ops' Asgardeo groups. That mismatch is deliberate and matches
// how Finance handles its three backends: the value here is a coarse hint for
// anything that renders the registry generically, while the REAL decision is
// made by useMarketingOpsGate against this backend's own /api/me capabilities.
//
// So: `requires: ["admin"]` here means "restricted", and the gate decides who
// actually sees it. An item that declares `requires` but is missing from the
// gate's explicit mapping is HIDDEN, never shown — see RESTRICTED_IDS there.
//
// ---- paths ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// An item with a `path` tells the rail there's a route to navigate to, so
// adding one before the route exists produces a rail entry that leads to a
// blank page. Every item now has one — all five operations are ported — but a
// future item should stay path-less until its route lands.
//
// ---- order ---------------------------------------------------------------
//
// THIS ARRAY'S ORDER IS THE DISPLAY ORDER, in the left rail, the waffle and the
// overview page alike. It is Sarindu's, chosen by how much the operations are
// used rather than by name or by the order they were ported in: Email
// Workbench, Ad Campaigns, Events, CRM Upload, then Utilities, with Marketing
// Admin last because it configures the rest. Don't sort it.
