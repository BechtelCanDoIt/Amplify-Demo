// What a table too wide for the viewport says about itself.
//
// Spec §11.8, ticket 08. The decision it implements: **the notice appears and
// the table still renders**. It is a sentence above a table, not a replacement
// for one — every figure stays reachable by scrolling, with the row-label
// column pinned, which is what makes an honest notice better than a substitute
// layout.
//
// ---- why a notice rather than a narrow layout ------------------------------
//
// The rejected candidate was the prototype's Variant C: one Period at a time,
// rendered vertically, which fits 400px. Measured against the real Build it
// answers for ONE of the four tables. The Subscription Build needs 1,138px at
// its default Years Back (a 288px pinned label column plus five Periods at
// 170px), and Variant C takes it to 458px. But Software/Cloud Customers needs
// 8,170px at its narrowest breakdown — 2,920px of that is identity columns
// before a single figure — and reducing it to one Period still leaves 3,970px.
// Its width comes from per-Period BREADTH, not from the Period count, so the
// mechanism that rescues the Build does nothing for it.
//
// Shipping Variant C would therefore mean two mechanisms on one screen, with
// period-over-period comparison vanishing on one tab and not the others. One
// honest notice beats that.
//
// The tension ticket 08 names is real and is not papered over: the shell
// otherwise promises every screen works at every width, and this is an
// admission that the Build does not do so comfortably. It is true, and a reader
// told the truth can act on it.
//
// ---- it compares against the table's OWN width -----------------------------
//
// `tableMinWidth` is COMPUTED from the column model rather than measured off
// the DOM (`buildTableModel.ts`), which is what makes this both honest and
// testable: no layout is involved, so jsdom models it exactly.
//
// A fixed 1,024px threshold was the first attempt and was wrong, for a reason
// worth keeping written down: **the Build is not one width.** This same page
// serves QRR and MRR, where Years Back defaults to 1 — up to eight quarters
// (1,648px) or thirteen months (2,498px) — while Software/Cloud Customers is
// 8,170px and a BU Summary at `?years=1` is 380px. A fixed threshold told a
// reader on a 400px screen that a 380px table was "wider than your screen",
// which is false, and said nothing at 1,100px about a table needing 8,170px.

 * the notice can arrive on a RESIZE, long after first paint.
