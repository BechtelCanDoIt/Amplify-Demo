// Context-sensitive left rail, built on Oxygen's compound `Sidebar`.
//
// Everything visual comes from the library: `Sidebar.ItemLabel` renders the
// selected row at weight 600 and every other row at 400, `Sidebar.ItemIcon`
// tints the active icon `primary.main`, and `Sidebar.Item` supplies the group
// chevron plus a hover flyout when the rail is collapsed. This component
// deliberately sets NO font weights, colours, or paddings of its own — if a
// style literal creeps back in here, the migration has regressed.
//
// Sections still render generically from the perspective registry: a leaf is
// either a route (`path`) or a scroll-anchor (`id`); a section with `children`
// is a collapsible group whose children are filtered by capability. A group
// with a single visible child collapses to a plain leaf (e.g. Menu → Home).
//
// Oxygen's Sidebar is id-based (`activeItem` + `onSelect`) rather than
// link-based, which suits that route/anchor duality better than the NavLink
// tree this replaces: route items are wrapped in a real anchor so
// middle-click and cmd-click still work, and anchor-only items fall through
// to `onSelect`.
