/**
 * The landing route for a perspective that has no overview of its own.
 *
 * Finance, Legal, People Ops and Security each used to open on a page of tiles
 * — one per rail item, built by hand, sitting two feet to the right of the rail
 * that already listed them. Reaching a screen took two clicks instead of one,
 * and every item added to a registry had to be remembered in a second place or
 * the tile page quietly fell behind. So these perspectives now open on the first
 * screen you can actually use, and the Overview row leaves their rail with it
 * (`forwardsToFirstItem` in @constants/perspectives).
 *
 * The route itself stays, because it is still reached — switching perspective
 * navigates to its `path` — and because someone who can see nothing here has to
 * be told that somewhere.
 *
 * States, and the order is the point:
 *
 *   have one  → go to it NOW, even if another gate this perspective also
 *               depends on is still resolving. `firstVisibleLeaf` is already
 *               the RAIL-ORDER-correct answer — it does not report a leaf
 *               until every section ranked above it has answered too, so
 *               there is no lower-ranked leaf here to later get bumped by a
 *               higher-ranked one landing late (see `firstVisibleLeaf` in
 *               railActive.ts). Waiting past this point would only hold
 *               someone on a backend that has nothing to do with the item
 *               they are about to open.
 *   resolving → hold. Nothing decidable YET could still resolve to a leaf once
 *               every gate above it settles, and reporting "nothing here" on
 *               an incomplete answer would send people chasing access they
 *               already hold.
 *   failed    → say so, with a Retry. Checked BEFORE the empty state for the
 *               same reason MarketingOpsShell checks it there: a failed request
 *               also leaves us with nothing to show, and reporting that as "you
 *               have no access" sends people chasing a permission they hold.
 *   have none → one sentence saying so, and where access comes from.
 *
 * Everything here reads from usePerspectiveVisibility, which is the rail's own
 * gate wiring — so this cannot send you somewhere the rail is hiding, or refuse
 * you a perspective whose rail has rows in it.
