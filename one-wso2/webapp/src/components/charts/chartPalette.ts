// The chart palette for NEW charts in One WSO2, and the chrome around them.
//
// ---- these values are computed, not chosen ---------------------------------
//
// Every hex below is a documented slot from the `dataviz` skill's reference
// palette, and the pair was run through that skill's validator against THIS
// app's own surfaces rather than the skill's — `#FFFFFF` light and `#141417`
// dark, from `config/brandTheme.ts`. Both modes pass all five computable
// checks:
//
//   light  band PASS · chroma PASS · CVD ΔE 24.7 · normal-vision ΔE 33.6 · contrast PASS
//   dark   band PASS · chroma PASS · CVD ΔE 26.8 · normal-vision ΔE 31.8 · contrast PASS
//
// (ΔE is OKLab ×100 under protanopia, Machado-Oliveira-Fernandes 2009 at
// severity 1.0; the target is ≥ 8 and the normal-vision floor is ≥ 15.)
//
// **Re-run the validator before changing any value here**, once per mode. The
// script is the `dataviz` skill's rather than this repo's — it is not under
// `scripts/` here — so run it from that skill's base directory:
//
//   node scripts/validate_palette.js "#2a78d6,#eb6834" --mode light --surface "#FFFFFF"
//   node scripts/validate_palette.js "#3987e5,#d95926" --mode dark  --surface "#141417"
//
// ---- two slots, deliberately -----------------------------------------------
//
// Not eight. A palette is a liability in proportion to its size: the reference
// palette's own note records that past three slots no ordering clears the
// all-pairs floors, and that its fourth puts yellow and orange on screen
// together. Slots are added here when a chart needs one and the validator says
// the set still passes — never in advance.
//
// ---- how this relates to the Marketing Ops palette -------------------------
//
// `features/marketing-ops/ad-campaigns/analytics/chartTheme.ts` has its own, and
// keeps it: its series colours are ported unchanged from the tool the marketing
// team uses today, so its charts read the same in both apps — a continuity
// argument that is real and specific to that port. That file already records
// its own deviation from this skill (it CYCLES a nine-colour list). Neither is
// wrong; they answer different questions. New charts with no such continuity
// obligation use this module, and Marketing Ops can adopt it whenever its
// parallel period ends.

 * Slot 1 — blue. The default for a single series, and the first of a pair.

 * than a preference: colouring nominal bars by their own value double-encodes
 * what bar length already shows and spends the identity channel on nothing.

 * at all. Applies to stacked segments and to adjacent bars alike.
