/**
 * Binds a screen's pure view codec to the address bar.
 *
 * Finance MIS is the first route in One WSO2 to carry filter state in the URL —
 * `features/pinned/pinnableRoute.ts` said as much before it arrived — so the
 * binding is built here, shared, rather than inside the first app to need it.
 * The vocabulary stays with the screen; what is shared is only this: read the
 * query string, and write one back without turning the back button into a log
 * of every filter the reader tried.
 *
 * The URL is the single source of truth. The source MIS app instead kept the
 * view in React state and mirrored it into the address on an effect, which
 * needed a first-render snapshot, a ref to the live location, and a guard
 * against the mirror racing its own write. None of that is needed if the
 * address IS the state; `setView` navigates, the router re-renders, and the
 * view comes back out of the codec.

   * Replaces the current history entry rather than pushing one: applying a
   * filter is not a step the reader should have to take back one at a time, and
   * an entry per applied filter buries the page they arrived from.
   *
   * The serialised view becomes the whole query string, so anything else the
   * address was carrying does not survive. That is what "a view is fully
   * described by its URL" costs, and the alternative — merging — leaves
   * parameters behind that no longer describe anything on screen.
   *
   * The fragment is left as it was. It is not part of the view, and replacing
   * the address with a query-only URL would drop an in-page link's target.
