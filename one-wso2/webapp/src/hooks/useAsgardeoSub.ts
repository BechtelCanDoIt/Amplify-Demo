 *
 * That "whether or not" is not a hedge, it is the actual bug this closes.
 * The effect below ALSO clears `resolvedSub` when it observes `isSignedIn`
 * go false — but that only runs for an instance that is both mounted and
 * re-renders with the new value. `AuthGuard` swaps its whole authenticated
 * subtree for a spinner in the SAME render that `isSignedIn` goes false,
 * unmounting every consumer of this hook before any of them gets a chance to
 * react to the very prop change that is tearing them down. A component torn
 * down never re-renders to observe what tore it down. So on every normal
 * sign-out, `resolvedSub` was left holding the outgoing user's identity —
 * and the next account to sign in in the same tab would seed straight from
 * it, synchronously, before its own token had even been read, issuing its
 * first requests under the PREVIOUS user's subject until decoding caught up.
 *
 * The effect's own clear stays, for a sign-out that does not reach
 * `useSecureSignOut` at all — Asgardeo's own session-expiry detection, say,
 * which sets `isSignedIn` false directly with no callback of ours in the
 * loop. Belt and braces: this function is the belt.

// indefinitely disabled query — `enabled: ... && Boolean(userSub)` never
// flips true while identity is unresolved, so the query itself never runs.
// Every sub-keyed query (leave, finance backends, ...) should route its
// result through this before returning it — this generalizes the pattern
// useMeProfile introduced for its own single query.
//
// Two branches, in order of precedence:
//
//  1. Identity failed — synthesize a real, actionable error (unchanged from
//     before). Takes precedence over whatever error state the query itself
//     happens to carry: React Query's real refetch() bypasses `enabled`
//     (see the note on useMeProfile above), so a disabled query CAN end up
//     with a real isError from some earlier forced refetch attempt (a stray
//     double-click, the devtools' manual refetch, ...) even while identity
//     is unresolved. Deferring to that instead would show whatever
//     unrelated error that fetch produced, with `.refetch` pointing at
//     React Query's real refetch — which just re-fires the same doomed
//     queryFn instead of ever retrying identity, permanently shadowing the
//     one error that's actually recoverable.
//
//  2. Identity is still resolving AND the query has no data of its own yet
//     (`isPending`) — synthesize a loading state. Without this, a disabled
//     query with no cached data reports `isLoading: false` in React Query
//     v5 (`isLoading` there is `isPending && isFetching`, and a disabled
//     query is never `isFetching`), so every caller of this hook — CC, OPD
//     and Expense Claims user-info alike — briefly read as "settled, and
//     access denied" during the gap between mount and identity resolving,
//     before the real query ever gets a chance to run. `FinanceOverviewPage`
//     and every finance rail gate compute `isResolving` from these hooks'
//     `isLoading`, so that gap read as the whole Finance section flashing
//     "not available for your role" (or its skeleton) before settling on
//     the real answer a moment later — reported as the app "continuously
//     refreshing" or "flickering". `isPending` (not `isSuccess`/`isError`)
//     is the guard: once the query has resolved for real at least once, a
//     later identity re-check (a token refresh cycle, say) must not hide
//     already-known-good data or a real error behind a fresh skeleton.
//
// The synthetic results don't match React Query's discriminated union
// exactly (the four *Result variants have exclusive boolean flags), so we
// cast through unknown — callers only read isError + error + isPending +
// isLoading + isFetching + isSuccess + refetch, and both shapes set those
// consistently.
